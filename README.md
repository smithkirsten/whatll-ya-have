## Abstract:

[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

There are lots of great reasons to give up alcohol, but the reality is that a lot of our culture's social time revolves around it. Whether you find yourself suddenly empty-handed during the company happy hour or want to find a new way to fill fancy cups at brunch, What'll Ya Have is here to help!

Users can browse alcohol-free drinks for any occasion and click a drink card to view recipe details. A user can save their favorites by clicking the heart icon on the details page and viewing their collection on a dedicaed favorites page.
